# Quiz-App

Developed this project as part of the Udacity Code Reviewer training.

The requirements were to create a quiz layout with at least four different Views, and a method that verifies the answers and displays the final results in a Toast. I chose to present ten questions about science in a combination of free text answers and multiple choice answers.

Here is the the link to the apk hosted on G-Drive
